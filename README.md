# Dexible

[Dexible](https://dexible.io) is a fully automated Execution Management System for DeFi. In its simplest form, Dexible takes on the responsibility of executing DeFi "orders" according to user-specified "policies". Policies basically dictate **how** execution should be carried out. 

## Dexible SDK

The SDK is a Python 3 library that gives developers and trade strategists a simple way of interacting with the Dexible infrastructure. From getting quotes, submitting orders, and querying for past orders, the SDK makes it easier to call the appropriate API endpoints with the proper signatures.
